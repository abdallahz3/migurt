migrt uses [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) to parse environment
variables from a `.env` file when `process.env.NODE_ENV != 'production'`.

Below are the environment variables and their defaults:

```javascript
DATABASE_URL=
DIRECTORY_DOWN_MIGRATIONS="./db/migrations/down"
DIRECTORY_DOWN_SEEDS="./db/seeds/down"
DIRECTORY_UP_MIGRATIONS="./db/migrations/up"
DIRECTORY_UP_SEEDS="./db/seeds/up"
TABLE_NAME_MIGRATIONS="public.migrations"
TABLE_NAME_SEEDS="public.seeds"
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add MySQL support.
